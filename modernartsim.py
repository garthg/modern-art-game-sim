# simulate Modern Art

# So many horrifying simplistic assumptions
# - All players have continuous perfect knowledge of everybodyâ€™s cash
# - All players have continuous access to an identical perfect oracle that tells them what the painting is going to be worth at the end
# - Only plays the first round (the one with max 30 value per painting)
# - Paintings are random order of 4x30, 3x20, 2x10 (9 paintings), not chosen strategically by players
# - Auction types are just combined and we simulate by taking the average of the two highest bids as the final price (sometimes seller-favored, sometimes buyer-favored, so we average it??)
# - Players always start with 100 cash and if they don't have enough to make their desired bid they bid their whole cash
